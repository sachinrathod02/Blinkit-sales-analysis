- # Process
-- Data Collection:

--Data Cleaning:
-Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and ensure data accuracy.
-Standardize formats for fields like dates, categories, and numerical values.

--Data Transformation:
-Perform calculations for KPIs (e.g., total sales, average sales, and ratings).
-Create derived columns or tables for metrics like fat content distribution, item visibility, and outlet segmentation.

--Data Import:
-Load the cleaned and transformed dataset into Power BI or another BI tool.

--Dashboard Design:
-Create visuals for KPIs using appropriate charts:
-Pie charts for sales distribution (e.g., fat content, outlet size).

-Add labels, legends, and titles for clarity.
-Highlight important metrics (e.g., Total Sales, Average Sales) with bold or larger text.

--Validation and Testing:
-Verify the accuracy of visualizations and KPIs by cross-checking with source data.
-Ensure filters and slicers work correctly.

--Deployment:
-Publish the dashboard to a shared workspace or integrate it into a reporting platform.
-Grant access to stakeholders for real-time monitoring and analysis.

--Iteration:
-Gather feedback from users to improve functionality and visuals.
-Update the dashboard regularly with new data and insights.
